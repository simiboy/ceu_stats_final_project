## Linear models
We already tested above the influence of different socioeconomic factors effects on people's support for the republican party and how the presence of Fox News in some cities changed people's party choices. However, we are also interested in to what extent socioeconomic factors or the potential effect of Fox News' presence in some cities influence people's vote for the Republican party. To answer this questions we will test H1 (Fox news and the socioeconomic background affects the behavior of the electorate) and H2 (just socioeconomic background affects the behavior of the electorate) through regression analysis. First, we will test to what extent socioeconomic factors affect people's vote for the Republican party. We included in the analysis the proportion of inhabitants who have a college degree, the median income, and the proportion of black or Hispanic people in every city. Black and Hispanic people stand for minorities in the analysis because these are the two most significant minorities and only these two minorities were included in the data set.
